As a software engineer it's been a couple years,
I always trying to convince myself to do something for achievement,
but the truth is it never happened.

The reason is really simple, **I'm just don't try to push on**.
There's so many times I got an idea but actually not work on it.
And even I start doing that at the first time but don't finished it.

**It's time to grow up**.

## The Journey

To make it clear, I have to make a plan for myself.
For this year, I have to finish:

- Improve my English skill
    Such as writing, reading, speaking,
    another skill is translating,
    but for now, I should focus on communication first.


- Implement my own blog
    a.k.a [just-func.com](/),
    which I can share what I learn and share what I know for you.


- Finish my side projects:
    - Travel Plan:
        This is a big project for myself and I'm every excited about it.
    - Taiwan indie Music calendar:
        The project which collect music event in Taiwan from the internet
        and show on calendar.


- Learn Data Science
    Even I describe myself as a frontend engineer,
    I still every interesting about the AI / ML technology,
    it's real magic.
