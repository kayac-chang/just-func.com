As a software engineer, it's been a couple years,
I'm always trying to convince myself to do something for achievement.
But the truth is, it never happened.

The reason is really simple, **I'm just don't trying to push on**.
So many times, I've had an idea but never followed through on it.
And even I started doing that the first time but didn't finish it.

**It's time to grow up**.

## The Journey

To make it clear, I have to make a plan for myself.
For this year, I have to finish:

### Improve my English skills

Such as writing, reading, speaking.
Another skill is translating.
But for now, I should focus on communication first.

### Implement my own blog

a.k.a [just-func.com](/),
which I can share what I learn and what I know with you.

### Finish my side projects

- Travel Plan:
  This is a big project for myself, and I'm very excited about it.
- Indie Music calendar in Taiwan:
  The project that collects music events in Taiwan from the internet and put it on the calendar.

- Learn Data Science
  Even through I describe myself as a frontend engineer,
  Everything about AI / ML technology continues to fascinate me.
  It's real magic.
